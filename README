This is Valarray implemetation using concept of proxies and doing lazy evaluation to save space and increase efficiency.

example: 
	Valarray<int> a{1,2,3};
	Valarray<int> b{3,4,5};


	Valarray<int> result = a + b; // This computes results and allocte space for it.

	cout << (a + b);   // Proxies are used that evaluates expression temporarily (lazy evaluation), without any allocation of unnecessary space.
